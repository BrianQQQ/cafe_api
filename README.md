- Created an API service using the Flask framework. This API allows users to query cafe information.
- Allows users to send a query (Read) to retrieve all cafes in the database, or search for cafes by their location, or randomly provide a cafe to users.
- Allows users to Read, Update (Patch), and Delete the cafeâ€™s information from the database.
- The query response is in JSON format, allowing for quick and light data exchange.
- Created an automated testing environment for all API routes using GitHub Actions to ensure robustness and reliability.
